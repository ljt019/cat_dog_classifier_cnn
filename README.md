# Cat and Dog Sketch Classifier

This project contains a machine learning model that differentiates between sketches of cats and dogs. It was created as a learning exercise to understand how AI models work and how to train them.

## Project Structure

- `quickdraw_data/` - Directory containing `cat.npy` and `dog.npy` files.
- `cat_dog_classifier.bin` - Trained model file.
- `config.json` - Configuration file with parameters for the model and training.
- `model.py` - Contains the model definition for the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
- `sample_predictions.png` - Image file with sample predictions from the model.
- `train_cat_dog_classifier.py` - Script to train the classifier.
- `requirements.txt` - Python Dependencies needed to run the training script

## Dependencies

To install the required Python packages to train the model, use the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
